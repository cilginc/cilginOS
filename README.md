## Fix these

- [ ] swww not works when autostart
- [ ] gtk theme config's are still not working
- [ ] polkit is not working

# TODO

- [x] Add packages such as
- nvim
- fzf
- hyprland
- foot or kitty or ghostty
- waybar
- nemo
- git
- wofi
- Zen Browser (AUR)
- starship

- [x] Configure AUR packages
- [x] Add my configuration files

- Should i use my config or something like nvchad
- [ ] Add my neovim config

- [x] Configure to autostart Hyprland

- 2.2GB is ok i think
- [x] Make the smallest and efficient as possible

- [x] Configure sudo add cilgin

- [x] Auto login as a **cilgin** user

- I probably can't do that beacuse my dotfiles are not for small systems. Maybe zsh and starship. But not hyprland and nvim.
- [ ] Add my dotfiles repo and build the iso with it

- [ ] Detect GPU and autoinstall graphics drivers with that also autoconfigure Hyprland config with that

- [ ] Make a github workflow for building and releasing OS

- [ ] Make a release branch with tagging

- [ ] Configure networkmanager for preconfigured protonvpn

## Maybe later

- [ ] Add calamares support

- [ ] Make your own arch repository
